- Total lifetime days display

**Usage:**
```python
python age-calculator.py
```

#### 2. Discount Calculator (discount-calculator.py)
**Description:** Application that calculates the new price based on product price and discount rate.

**Features:**
- Original price and discount percentage input
- Discount amount calculation
- New price and savings amount display

**Usage:**
```python
python discount-calculator.py
```

#### 3. Personal Budget (personal-budget.py)
**Description:** Application that analyzes budget status by comparing income and expenses.

**Features:**
- Income and expense input
- Remaining amount calculation
- Surplus/deficit/balanced status analysis
- Conditional statements (if/elif/else) usage

**Usage:**
```python
python personal-budget.py
```

#### 4. Restaurant Calculator (restaurant-calculator.py)
**Description:** Application that calculates restaurant bill including tip and finds the amount per person.

**Features:**
- Food price, tip percentage, and number of people input
- Tip calculation
- Total amount calculation
- Per-person payment amount calculation

**Usage:**
```python
python restaurant-calculator.py
```

#### 5. Simple Converter (simple-converter.py)
**Description:** Multi-option converter application that performs unit conversions.

**Features:**
- Meter ↔ Feet conversion
- Kilogram ↔ Pound conversion
- Menu-based selection system
- Precise calculation (decimal values)

**Usage:**
```python
python simple-converter.py
```

### Module-2: Advanced Applications

#### 1. Grade System (grade-system.py)
**Description:** System that converts numeric grades to letter grades and determines pass/fail status.

**Grade Scale:**
- 90-100: A (Passed)
- 80-89: B (Passed)
- 70-79: C (Passed)
- 60-69: D (Passed)
- 0-59: F (Failed)

**Usage:**
```python
python grade-system.py
```

#### 2. Restaurant Ordering (restaurant-ordering.py)
**Description:** Restaurant ordering system that takes orders from menu and calculates total amount.

**Menu:**
- Burger - $10
- Pizza - $15
- Pasta - $12
- Salad - $8
- Drink - $3

**Features:**
- Loop (while) usage
- List data structure
- Multiple item selection
- Order summary and total amount display

**Usage:**
```python
python restaurant-ordering.py
```

#### 3. Tax Calculator (tax-calculator.py)
**Description:** Application that calculates tax based on annual income and finds net income.

**Tax Rates:**
- 0-10,000: 0%
- 10,001-30,000: 10%
- 30,001-60,000: 20%
- 60,001-100,000: 30%
- 100,000+: 40%

**Usage:**
```python
python tax-calculator.py
```

#### 4. Credit Card (credit-card.py)
**Status:** Under development

#### 5. Rock-Paper-Scissors Game (r-p-s-game.py)
**Status:** Under development

## Requirements
